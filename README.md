ORC provides a constrained REST client engine for use with client proxies generated by [VIPR] and [VIPR-T4TemplateWriter].

[VIPR]: https://github.com/microsoft/vipr
[VIPR-T4TemplateWriter]: https://github.com/msopentech/vipr-t4templatewriter

To use ORC with a generated library, add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'orc', '=0.10.0'
```

To import the entire library, use `#include <orc/orc.h>`.
To import only specific headers, use one of the following:

```obj-c
#include <orc/api/_header-name_.h>
#include <orc/core/_header-name_.h>
#include <orc/impl/_header-name_.h>
```
